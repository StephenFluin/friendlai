    Friendlai is built to be a decentralized AI platform that is slower, worse quality, but much cheaper and easier to
  scale because it pays out to the community.

    There are too many GPUs and powerful chips sitting unused around the world. For these folks that we call "providers",
    Friendlai uses these resources and gets them paid. Think of it like Seti&commat;Home or Folding at Home but for AI -- and
    you get paid.
